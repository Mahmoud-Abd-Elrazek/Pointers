Memory - Storage area [Data & instructions]
large array of bytes, for each byte has an address.

We express these addresses in base 16 numbers. For instance, 
the smallest possible address is 0x00000000 (where the 0x means base 16), and 
the largest possible address could be 0xFFFFFFFF.

Stack:
Stack memory is a region of memory used for storing local variables and function call information during program execution.

- follows a Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure.
- Store temporary data (local variables) created by functions.
- grows downward as more data is added. 

Key characteristics of stack memory:
    1] Automatic memory management: When a function is called, its local variables are automatically allocated on the stack, and when the function returns, the memory is automatically deallocated.
    
    2] Function call management: The stack holds return addresses, parameters, and local variables for each function call.

    2] Limited size: Stack memory is limited in size compared to heap memory. A stack overflow occurs if too much memory is used, typically through deep recursion.
    stack is typically a few megabytes (e.g., 1 MB to 8 MB by default)

    3] Fast access: Accessing stack memory is faster because it is managed directly by the CPU.

    In summary, the stack is used for temporary data storage that is automatically managed and limited in size, making it ideal for function calls and local variables.


2] Heap memory: Memory allocated to heaps can be dynamically allocated, unlike memory allocated to stacks. also known as “dynamic” memory.

- variables that are created during program execution(runtime) are called dynamic variables with the help of pointers C++ creates dynamic variables. New , delete create and destroy dynamic variables. reserved words.

- Store data not tied to a specific function.
- No specific order (structure).
- larger size. used for larg, complex data structures.
- Dynamic allocation and deallocation during runtime. more flexible.

- more challenging.
- lead to memory leaks or other memory-related errors.
- slower than stack memory.
